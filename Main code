PURPOSE: to find the root of a given function by using Newton method and passing out function handle
%
%
% INPUTS: fh-function handle
%         guess-the initial value of root x that was guessed
%         the tolerance of error in percentage% 
% 
% OUTPUT: xr-root of x
%         yr- value of y at root xr
%         n- number of repetition of functions runs

function[xr, yr, n] = Newton_2522(fh, guess, tol)

xr = guess;% guess will be the initial value of root
n = 0;%set number of steps taken as 0 at the beginning
xo = 0;% set the old value of root as 0

while abs((xr-xo)/xr)*100 > tol %set condition for while loop running
   [yr,yp] = fh (xr,xr); %use function handle to get yprime and value of yr at xr(initial value of root)
   xo = xr; % the old value of the root
   xr = xr-yr/yp;  %use formula to calculate value of new x root
   n = n+ 1; %set number of repetition 
   
   if n > 100 %if the iteration more than 100, the method is not working
       xr = NaN; %set xr equal to NaN
       yr = NaN; %set Yr equal to NaN
       return %stop the function but still goes for the following line
   end %end of if statement
   
end %end of while loop

yr = fh(xr); %calculate the value of y at root x with given function handle

end %end of function
